Use demo.sh to start a quick demo without Mininet. Use stop.sh to stop the demo.

To run experiments, you need Mininet. If running Mininet inside a container,
the host machine must load the openvswitch kernel module by installing
openvswitch-switch.

Use process.py to process results and save into a JSON file, and use data_to_plot.py
to produce files for LaTeX. The core simulation is in pure Golang.

Python deps:
- python-dateutil

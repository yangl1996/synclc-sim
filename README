Code for paper: Securing Proof-of-Stake Nakamoto Consensus Under Bandwidth Constraint

Authors: Joachim Neu, Srivatsan Sridhar, Lei Yang, David Tse, Mohammad Alizadeh

Building
========

Run "go build" to build the consensus node. Use demo.sh to start a quick demo without
Mininet. Use stop.sh to stop the demo.

Running Experiments
===================

To reproduce the experimental results, you need Mininet. If running Mininet inside a
container, the host machine must load the openvswitch kernel module by installing
openvswitch-switch. We recommend following the "installing from source" instructions
to install Mininet. Make sure that the python command goes to python3 (install
python-is-python3 on Ubuntu).

Use process.py to process results and save into a JSON file, and use data_to_plot.py
to produce files for LaTeX.

Python deps:
- python-dateutil
